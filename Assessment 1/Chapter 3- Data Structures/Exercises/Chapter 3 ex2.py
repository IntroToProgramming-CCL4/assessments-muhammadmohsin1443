#Exercise 2: Greetings, printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

# Storing names of friends in a single list
names = ["Anas","Awais","Mehran","Ali","Omar","Shahab", "Tayyab", "Asad"]

# Printing a personalized message to each person in the list
for name in names:
    print(f"As salam o alaikum, {name}, I hope you are doing well!")
